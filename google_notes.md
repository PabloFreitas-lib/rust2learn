# Day 1

Rust is a static compiled language, like C,C++ etc...

One unique selling point from rust, which cought my attention was the compile time memory safety. Which means no segment fault, if I am right?! No null pointers, no unitialized variables, no double free, etc..

When compiling rust you can choose two "profiles": Debug and Release. One with more tests, the other with more optimization.

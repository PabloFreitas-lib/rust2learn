# Rust-Tagesbuch

What about I do some journaling in each Rust topic?! That is my plan here. Below some goals:

1. Get use with the syntax: How to create a basic application, compile and run.
2. Go over 5 basic topics in programming: Variables and Mutability, Data Types, Functions, Comments, Control Flow
3. Practicing over 50 basic problems/puzzles

# Installation

- Here was using the [tutorial](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) presented. I had before the rust from brew, but I got some problems with the VS Code extension (rust-analyser). That is why I changed the installation and added the bin paths into my global variable PATH.
